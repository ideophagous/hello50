Hello World in 50 programming languages

Just a silly challenge to write a hello world program in 50 programming languages. The only two conditions are that the compiler has to be installed on a local machine, and the program has to be written manually, and run successfully.

1- Ada: hello.adb

2- C++: hello.cpp

3- Fortran: hello.f90

4- Perl: hello.pl

More will be added soon!
