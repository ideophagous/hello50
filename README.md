Hello World in 50 programming languages

Just a silly challenge to write a hello world program in 50 programming languages. The only two conditions are that the compiler has to be installed on a local machine, and the program has to be written manually, and run successfully.

1- Ada: hello.adb

2- C: hello.c

3- C++: hello.cpp

4- Fortran: hello.f90

5- Perl: hello.pl

6- Python 3: hello3.py

More will be added soon!
