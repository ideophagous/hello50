Hello World in 50 programming languages - 33/50

A personal challenge to write a hello world program in 50 programming languages. 

## Conditions:
- The compiler has to be installed on a local machine (not using an online compiler), both for Windows and Linux (Ubuntu).
- The program has to be written manually.
- It must be run successfully with no errors (message "Hello World" printed on the console or equivalent).
- *[new condition]* The instructions for installation, compilation and running the hello world program must be provided here.

## 50 languages:
*Alphabetically ordered:*

1. Ada: hello.adb

1. Assembly (MASM32): hello.asm

    **On Windows:**
    - Install MASM32: https://www.masm32.com/download.htm
    - Make sure the path to MASM32 bin folder is in the PATH environment variable
    - Run the following instructions on the Windows command line:
    ```
    > cd path/to/script/folder
    > ml /c /coff /Cp hello.asm
    > link /subsystem:console hello.obj

    ```
    - If you get en error, check if MinGW bin folder was added to the PATH environment variable.
    - Write your hello.cpp program and run the following instructions:
     ```
    > cd path/to/script/folder
    > g++ -o hello.exe hello.cpp
    > hello

    ```

1. VBScript: hello.vbs

1. Wyvern: hello.wyv

   **On Windows:**
   
   I was unsuccessful in running Wyvern on the command line, except through cygwin (which basically amounts to executing the program on a Linux system). The Wyvern language is also still a work in progress, so don't expect to be able to build a larger system in it yet.
   - Install cygwin: https://cygwin.com/install.html
   - Make sure you have a compatible Java version (in my case 9 or above): https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
   - Check if java was installed successfully:
   ```
   $ java -version
   ```
   - Download and unzip the wyvern package: https://wyvernlang.github.io/
   - Add the bin folder to the PATH environment variable.
   - Write your hello.wyv program and run the following commands:
   ```
   $ cd path/to/script/folder
   $ wyvern hello.wyv
   ```

More will be added soon!
