Hello World in 50 programming languages

Just a silly challenge to write a hello world program in 50 programming languages. The only two conditions are that the compiler has to be installed on a local machine, and the program has to be written manually, and run successfully.

1- Ada: hello.adb

2- Batch: hello.bat

3- C: hello.c

4- C++: hello.cpp

5- Elixir: hello.ex

6- Erlang: hello.erl

7- Fortran: hello.f90

8- Go: hello.go

9- Java: hello.java

10- Javascript: hello.js (hello.html is also needed to display the message on the browser console)

11- Linux Shell: hello.sh

12- Perl: hello.pl

13- PL/SQL: hello_plsql.sql (run on Oracle SQL Developer)

14- Python 2: hello2.py

15- Python 3: hello3.py

16- SQL: hello.sql (run on Oracle SQL Developer)

More will be added soon!
